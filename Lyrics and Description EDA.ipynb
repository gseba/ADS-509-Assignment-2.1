I was surprised, however, by the high lexical diversity at the upper range for both, especially seeing that Robyn achieved a max value of 1 and Cher was not far behind. I was not expecting these ranges for pop artists, who I thought wrote simple songs with repetitive lyrics. When looking at the mean and median lexical diversity values, though, they align more with my original expectations, showing that while some songs have high diversity, the overall trend is more moderate.***\n"
